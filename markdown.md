# Markdown: a guide
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Guides%20and%20manuals-Markdown-%2315bbbb)

_Having been recently introduced to GitHub and the world of programming, I rapidly understood the importance of comprehensive README files for communicating any project (mainly, because, most of the time, any other way I have no idea what's going on). Those are formatted using Markdown, or, alternatively, HTML for more formatting options._

_This guide was developed from that understanding, with the hope it can be helpful to anyone out there._

> [!NOTE]
> **Disclaimer:** _I come from a background in design, so I also cry a little when I see unclear information hierarchy. Plus, I'm a firm believer that allocating time for organization and communication can boost efficiency in the future._
