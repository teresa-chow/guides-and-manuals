# (GitHub Flavored) Markdown: a guide
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Guides%20and%20manuals-Markdown-%2315bbbb)

_Having been recently introduced to GitHub and the world of programming, I rapidly understood the importance of comprehensive README files for communicating any project (mainly, because, most of the time, any other way I have no idea what's going on). Those are formatted using Markdown, or, alternatively, HTML for more formatting options._

_This guide was developed from that understanding, with the hope it can be helpful to anyone else out there._

> [!NOTE]
> **Disclaimer:** _I come from a background in design, so I also cry a little when I see unclear information hierarchy. Plus, I'm a firm believer that allocating time for organization and communication can boost efficiency in the future._

## What

> _What is markdown?_

Markdown is a simplified markup language, adding formatting elements to plain text, created by John Gruber with the collaboration of Aaron Swartz in 2004.

In truth, it's both a plain text formatting syntax, and a "a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML". [^1]

GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) is a variant of Markdown based on CommonMark, following its specification apart from some added extensions (e.g.: _strikethrough, tables, alerts,..._). It suports HTML, and that's why one can use HTML tags instead of or in addition to Markdown formatting.

## Why

> _Why use markdown?_

Markdown's syntax is easy-to-learn and use, making it very fitting for software documentation due to its portability, flexibility and readability. It produces clear and consistent text.

___
## How

> _How to use markdown?_

Just write your documentation content using (GitHub Flavored) Markdown syntax and conventions, as shown below.

<details>
  <summary><h3>Headings</h3></summary>

> _Headings_ are used to name documents or sections within documents. They define importance, from the most important `# Heading 1` to the least important `###### Heading 6`.
> In defining sections, they are also useful when one wants to link content to a certain section. **See** _Links_.
  
  ```markdown
  # Heading 1
  ## Heading 2
  ### Heading 3
  #### Heading 4
  ##### Heading 5
  ######  Heading 6
  ```

  </br>

  > Here is how they are displayed:

  # Heading 1
  ## Heading 2
  ### Heading 3
  #### Heading 4
  ##### Heading 5
  ######  Heading 6

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h3>Paragraphs</h3></summary>

  > To create a _paragraph_, add a blank line in-between two or more lines of text.
  
  ```markdown
  Line 1

  Line 2
  ```

  </br>

  > Here is how they are displayed:

  Line 1

  Line 2

  

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h3>Italics, Bold and Strikethrough</h3></summary>
  
  > _Italic_, **Bold** and Strikethrough can be used to add emphasis. 
  
  ```markdown
  _italic_

  **bold**

  ~~strikethrough~~

  **_all in italics and bold_**

  _all in italics and **part in bold**_

  **all in bold and _part in italics_**
  ```

  </br>

  > Here is how they are displayed:

  _italic_
  
  **bold**

  ~~strikethrough~~
  
  **_all in italics and bold_**
  
  _all in italics and **nested bold**_
  
  **all in bold and _nested italics_**

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h3>Hyperlinks</h3></summary>

  > _Hyperlinks_ are used as a way to navigate online content, pointing to a specific location. In the present context, we can use them either to link to different pages, documents, _etc._, or to sections within our own document.

```markdown
[text](link address)

[text](#name-of-section)
